1. What is a lambda function in Python, and how does it differ from a regular function?
2. Can a lambda function in Python have multiple arguments? If yes, how can you define and use
them?
3. How are lambda functions typically used in Python? Provide an example use case.
4. What are the advantages and limitations of lambda functions compared to regular functions in
Python?
5. Are lambda functions in Python able to access variables defined outside of their own scope?
Explain with an example.

9. Write a lambda function to sort a list of strings in ascending order based on the length of each
string.
10. Create a lambda function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the
common elements between the two lists.
11. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer.
12. Implement a recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number.
